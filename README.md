# April-2021-forensic-quiz

This is a github repository for the April 2021 forensic quiz, located here: https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/April+2021+Forensic+Quiz/27266/

Password for either of the two zip archives from this repository is: infected

Of note, the file labled with "malware and artifacts" contains actual Windows-based malware.  I reccomend you don't open the malware and artifacts zip archive on a Windows host, because that poses a significant risk of infection.
